      "As part of the DevOps team, I maintained Jenkins pipelines to automate testing, reporting, and deployment for Unity projects. I was involved in designing new pipelines from the ground up for Node.js projects, implementing linting, static code analysis, unit testing and integration testing. Additionally, I established a containerization stage in the Jenkins pipeline using Docker and Azure Container Registry for streamlined depolyment. For our internal Jenkins server, I improved memory usage by 28% (from 242.9GB to 174.8GB) through automated scripting. I also managed Linux-based web servers and integrated them into the LMS platforms, such as Moodle and D2L Brightspace, using the LTI protocol, optimizing deployment and operational workflows for Unity projects.",

  //     "orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
